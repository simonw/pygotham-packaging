# pygotham-packaging

Notes from my presentation on Python packaging at PyGotham 2021

A more comprehensive version of these notes can be found on my blog: [How to build, test and publish an open source Python library](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Nov/4/publish-open-source-python-library/)

## Packaging a single module

I started out by creating a new `pids` package using [this code](https://github.com/CAVaccineInventory/vial/blob/main/vaccinate/core/baseconverter.py), which I have copied-and-pasted into several different projects over the years.

1. `mkdir pids && cd pids`
2. Create `pids.py` in that directory with the contents of [this file](https://github.com/CAVaccineInventory/vial/blob/main/vaccinate/core/baseconverter.py)
3. Create a new `setup.py` file in that folder containing the following:
    ```python
    from setuptools import setup

    setup(
        name="pids",
        version="0.1",
        description="A tiny Python library for generating public IDs from integers",
        author="Simon Willison",
        url="https://github.com/simonw/...",
        license="Apache License, Version 2.0",    
        py_modules=["pids"],
    )
    ```
4. Run `python3 setup.py sdist` to create the packaged source distribution, `dist/pids-0.1.tar.gz`

## Testing it in a Jupyter notebook

Having created that file, I demonstrated how it can be installed in a Jupyter notebook by running the following in a notebook cell:

    %pip install /Users/simon/Dropbox/Presentations/2021/pygotham/pids/dist/pids-0.1.tar.gz

Having done this, I could excute the library like so:

    >>> import pids
    >>> pids.pid.from_int(1234)
    'gxd'

## Uploading the package to PyPI

I used [twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine/) (`pip install twine`) to upload my new package to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). I had to paste in my PyPI account's username and password:
```
% twine upload dist/pids-0.1.tar.gz
Uploading distributions to https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
Enter your username: simonw
Enter your password: 
Uploading pids-0.1.tar.gz
100%|██████████████████████████████████████| 4.16k/4.16k [00:00<00:00, 4.56kB/s]

View at:
https://pypi.org/project/pids/0.1/
```
The release is now live at https://pypi.org/project/pids/0.1/ - and anyone can run `pip install pids` to install it.

## Adding a README

I added a `README.md` file [containing this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/pids/0.1.2/README.md). Then I modified my `setup.py` file to look like this:
```python
from setuptools import setup
import os

def get_long_description():
    with open(
        os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "README.md"),
        encoding="utf8",
    ) as fp:
        return fp.read()

setup(
    name="pids",
    version="0.1.1",
    long_description=get_long_description(),
    long_description_content_type="text/markdown",
    description="A tiny Python library for generating public IDs from integers",
    author="Simon Willison",
    url="https://github.com/simonw/...",
    license="Apache License, Version 2.0",    
    py_modules=["pids"],
)
```
Note that I updated the version number too.

Running `python3 setup.py sdist` created a new file called `dist/pids-0.1.1.tar.gz` - I then uploaded that file using `twine upload dist/pids-0.1.1.tar.gz` which created a new release with a visible README at https://pypi.org/project/pids/0.1.1/

## Adding some tests

I like using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for tests, so I added that as a test dependency by modifying `setup.py` to add the following line:

```python
    extras_require={"test": ["pytest"]}
```
Next, I created a virtual environment and installed my package and its test dependencies into it in "editable" mode like so:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[test]'
```
Now I can run the tests!

```
(venv) pids % pytest
============================= test session starts ==============================
platform darwin -- Python 3.9.6, pytest-6.2.5, py-1.10.0, pluggy-1.0.0

============================ no tests ran in 0.01s =============================
```
There aren't any tests yet. I created a `tests/` folder and then dropped in a `test_pids.py` file that looked like this:
```python
import pytest
import pids

def test_from_int():
    assert pids.pid.from_int(1234) == "gxd"

def test_to_int():
    assert pids.pid.to_int("gxd") == 1234
```
Running `pytest` in the project directory now runs those tests:
```
(venv) pids % pytest
============================= test session starts ==============================

```
## Creating a GitHub repository

I created a repository using the form at https://github.com/new

Having created the [simonw/pids](https://github.com/simonw/pids) repository, I ran the following commands locally to push my code to it (mostly copy and pasted from the GitHub example):
```
git init
git add README.md pids.py setup.py tests/test_pids.py
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:simonw/pids.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Running the tests with GitHub Actions

I copied in a `.github/workflows` folder from [another project](https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-explain/tree/main/.github/workflows) with two files, `test.yml` and `publish.yml`. The `.github/workflows/test.yml` file contained this:

```yaml
name: Test

on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9]
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - uses: actions/cache@v2
      name: Configure pip caching
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/pip
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/setup.py') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-pip-
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -e '.[test]'
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest
```
The `matrix` block there causes the job to run four times, on four different versions of Python. The steps checkout the current repository, install Python, configure pip caching and then install the test dependencies and run the tests.

I added and pushed the new files:

```
git add .github
git commit -m "GitHub Actions"
git push
```
The [Actions tab](https://github.com/simonw/pids/actions) in my repository instantly ran the test suite.

## Publishing a new release using GitHub

The `.github/workflows/publish.yml` file is triggered by new GitHub releases, testing them and then publishing them up to PyPI using `twine`. That file looks like this:

```yaml
name: Publish Python Package

on:
  release:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9]
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - uses: actions/cache@v2
      name: Configure pip caching
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/pip
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/setup.py') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-pip-
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -e '.[test]'
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [test]
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'
    - uses: actions/cache@v2
      name: Configure pip caching
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/pip
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-publish-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/setup.py') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-publish-pip-
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install setuptools wheel twine
    - name: Publish
      env:
        TWINE_USERNAME: __token__
        TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
      run: |
        python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        twine upload dist/*
```
It contains two jobs: the `test` job runs the tests again - we should never publish a package without first ensuring that the test suite passes - and then the `deploy` job runs `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` followed by `twine upload dist/*` to upload the resulting packages.

Before running that action, I needed to create a `PYPI_TOKEN` that the action could use to authenticate with my PyPI account.

I used the https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/ page to create that token:

<img width="784" alt="Add_API_token_·_PyPI" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9599/132279691-e3488807-428b-4a60-96e4-ecfb8a31f236.png">

I then copied and pasted the new secret token:

<img width="1251" alt="Add_API_token_·_PyPI" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9599/132279794-64054e62-6bdf-4b72-ad34-7a540b8bf41c.png">

And used the "Settings -> Secrets" tab on the GitHub repository to add that as a secret called `PYPI_TOKEN`:

<img width="1372" alt="Actions_secrets" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9599/132279901-0f063ebe-8da7-4701-a7c4-9e26fa5bc347.png">

(I have since revoked the token that I used in the video, since it is visible on screen to anyone watching.)

I used the GitHub web interface to edit `setup.py` to bump the version number in that file up to `0.1.2`, then I navigated to the [releases tab](https://github.com/simonw/pids/releases) in the repository, clicked "Draft new release" and created a release that would create a new `0.1.2` tag as part of the release process.

When I published the release, the `publish.yml` action started to run. After the tests had passed it pushed the new release to PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/pids/0.1.2/
